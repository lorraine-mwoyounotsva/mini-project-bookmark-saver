# Quick Marks - Bookmark Saver

Quick Marks is a minimalist web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to quickly save and manage bookmarks.
It stores links locally using the browser's `localStorage`, so your saved bookmarks are remembered even after refreshing.

## Features:
- Add bookmarks with a name and a valid URL
- Automatically opens links in new tabs
- Remove saved bookmarks
- Fully responsive and styled using a warm mustard + soft neutral theme

## What I Learned:
- DOM manipulation using `createElement`, `appendChild`, `addEventListener`
- Local storage basics (`getItem`, `setItem`, and JSON parsing/stringifying)
- Form validation including URL pattern checks
- Creating clean UI with flexbox and hover effects

This project helped with JavaScript logic, event-driven code, and designing with color schemes in CSS.
